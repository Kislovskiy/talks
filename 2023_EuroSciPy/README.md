# Why I Follow CI/CD Principles When Writing Code: Building Robust and Reproducible Applications

The talk was given on 16th of August 2023, at [EuroSciPy 2023](https://pretalx.com/euroscipy-2023/talk/UBT8PH/).

## TL;DR

* **Continuous Integration (CI):** CI is a software development technique that employs a set of well-defined principles
  and practices to streamline the development process.
* **Project Structure:** Treat every project as a Python package. This approach can save significant time and prevent
  potential issues.
* **Licensing:** Don’t neglect licensing. It explicitly communicates to others how they can or cannot utilize your code.
* **Code Testing:** Invest time in writing tests. They not only ensure code reliability but also guide proper
  modularization of the code.
* **Learn and Reuse:** Take inspiration from the best in the field. Don't hesitate to leverage and adapt code written by
  experienced developers.
* **Recommendation:** If you haven’t yet integrated CI into your workflow, it's highly advisable to do so. It can
  revolutionize your development process.
